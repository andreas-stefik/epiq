# Experience Programming in Quorum (epiq)
This is the public repository for the Experience Programming in Quorum professional development workshop. More information about EPIQ can be found on the [website for the conference](https://quorumlanguage.com/epiq.html). To run these examples, you need to obtain Quorum Studio 3.0 from the [Quorum Programming Language](https://quorumlanguage.com/) website. This tool will be released on July 9th, 2021.

To run each example, go into Scenes/ and then each project corresponds to a different day of professional development. Each project contains the answer key for that day's work, so that any user can continue in the conference without worrying about falling behind with the lessons. In each project, the scene in use can be opened in Quorum Studio under Scenes and the Project can be opened in the Project folder. To run any project, either use the hotkey (CTRL + R (PC) or CMD + R (Mac)) or click the run button. For screen reader users, we recommend NVDA.
